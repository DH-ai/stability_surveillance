Drone Stability with PID Control

This project, under the supervision of Professor Gopal Patil, focuses on using a PID controller to maintain the stability of a quadcopter drone. By adjusting motor speeds based on real-time sensor feedback from IMU sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), the drone achieves precise balance and smooth flight performance.
